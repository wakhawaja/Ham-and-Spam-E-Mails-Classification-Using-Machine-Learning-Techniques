# Ham and Spam Emails Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Description
This project aims to build a system that automatically classifies emails as either "Ham" (legitimate) or "Spam" (unwanted) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a reliable model that helps users manage their inboxes effectively by filtering spam emails.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and preparing email text for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF for extracting features from text.
- **Model Training**: Employs machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have:
- A trained machine learning model capable of classifying emails into "Ham" or "Spam" with high accuracy.
- Practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- Insights into handling real-world problems such as class imbalance in datasets.

## Dataset
We are using the [Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase), which contains email data labeled as "Ham" or "Spam."
