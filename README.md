# Ham-and-Spam-E-Mails-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this project, you will build a system that automatically classifies emails as either "Ham" (legitimate) or "Spam" (unwanted) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can differentiate between useful emails and spam emails, helping users manage their inboxes effectively.
